# Secure Data Network 🛡️🌐

This repository contains materials and resources for designing and implementing a **Secure Data Network**. The project focuses on VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask) subnetting, securing network infrastructures, and providing efficient designs for structured cabling and network connections. Below you'll find the project files, subnetting details, and connection diagrams.

## Contents 📂

- **VLSM Subnetting**: Detailed examples and calculations for creating efficient subnets based on your network requirements.
- **Cisco Packet Tracer Project**: Final project files used in Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate the network setup.
- **Connection Schemes**: Diagrams that illustrate the physical and logical network connections.
- **Structured Cabling Diagrams**: Visual representations of the structured cabling setup for the network infrastructure.

## Project Structure 📑

1. **VLSM Subnetting Calculations**:  
   - Subnetting examples and strategies for optimal network design using VLSM.
   - Calculations and step-by-step guides for subnetting large networks into smaller, more manageable subnets.

2. **Cisco Packet Tracer Files** 🖥️:  
   - **`final_project.pkt`**: The final simulation file for the network setup.
   - Cisco Packet Tracer is used to simulate the network configuration and verify its design.

3. **Structured Cabling Diagrams** 🛠️:  
   - Layouts for structured cabling based on industry standards.
   - Diagrams to ensure that the cabling infrastructure is optimized for performance and scalability.
